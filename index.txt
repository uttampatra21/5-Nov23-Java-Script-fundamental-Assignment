Problem Statement 1
Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even
or odd using the ternary operator.

ANS :

It evaluates the condition. If true, it returns the expression on the left of the colon; if false, it returns the expression on the right.

let number = 21;
let result = (number % 2 === 0) ? 'Even' : 'Odd';



Problem Statement 2
Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.

The comma operator in JavaScript allows multiple expressions to be grouped together. It evaluates each expression from left to right, returning the result of the rightmost expression. It is often used in places where a single expression is expected, but multiple actions are desired.

EXMP :

let x = 2, y = 3, z;
z = (x++, y++, x + y);


Problem Statement 3

Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print
“positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also.

ANS : 

let number = 42;
let result =
  number > 0 ? "positive" :
  number < 0 ? "negative" :
  "zero";

console.log(`The number is ${result}.`);



Problem Statement 4

Use a ternary operator to check that a person is eligible to vote or not by checking his age. If the age of the
person is less than 18 then “You cannot vote” should be logged else “You can vote” should be logged.

ANS : 
let age = 20;
let eligibility = (age < 18) ? "You cannot vote" : "You can vote";

console.log(eligibility);
